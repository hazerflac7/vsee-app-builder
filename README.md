# Vsee App Builder

**Vsee App Builder** is an Android TV app by TORR3NT's Tech. On a compatible V6 box, it checks the installed original apps and makes APKs in a dated folder in Downloads. The owner can choose which compatible apps to build, then copy those files to another Android TV device.

The screen has two actions: **Check compatibility** and **Make APKs**. The builder starts the temporary access it needs during the build. It does not install the generated APKs on the other device.

## Current status

Version **0.7.13** (`versionCode` 20) adds selectable app builds. Local build and package checks passed. On 2026-10-16, it was installed on a V6 Plus and **Check compatibility** matched all six installed original apps. Selected-app export and Shield playback have not yet been retested with 0.7.13. See [what changed in 0.7.13](docs/RELEASE-0.7.13.md).

The last owner-tested version is **0.7.12-design-preview** (`versionCode` 19). On one factory-reset V6 and a 2017 Shield, the owner reported that all six APKs were exported and worked. Its SHA-256 is `11a2063ebc2ae0cd0f3b64aa09ece3d532e24123cdd2e2f600761a0e71ae8eba`.

## Use on your own box

1. Use a V6 with the original apps you want to build installed and working. Heat Live must be present to read the box setup. See [supported versions](docs/SUPPORTED-APPS.md).
2. Install the builder APK on that V6 and read the first-launch testing notice. Continue only if you agree.
3. Select **Check compatibility**. If the TV remote merely highlights the button, press OK again.
4. Select the matching app tiles you want to build, then select **Make APKs**. Wait for the completion message.
5. Open the dated `Vsee-Apps-...` folder in Downloads. Copy the generated APKs to your other device and install them with its normal installer.

The generated APKs contain information from the owner's V6. **Do not upload or share them.** A new signing key after a factory reset may require uninstalling older generated apps before installing replacements; that can erase their app data.

This tool is for authorized testing. Using modified apps may affect service or account access. Read the [testing notice](docs/TESTING-NOTICE.md).

## Source and builds

`heat-live-collector/` holds the current builder source and six neutral app templates. `pc-only-helper/` holds the relay code that is packaged inside the builder. `tools/build-integrated-builder.py` assembles, merges, aligns, signs, and checks the installer. See [building from source](docs/BUILDING.md). A plain Gradle build omits the relay and is not the complete installer.

This repository starts with a fresh history of the current version. It does not include owner profiles, generated owner APKs, private signing keys, device logs, or older prototypes.
